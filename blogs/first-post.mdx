Testing Blog Publishing

## Introduction

Next.js and MDX provide a powerful combination for creating dynamic and interactive blog posts. This sample post demonstrates various markdown and code elements.

## Code Samples

Here are some code samples in different languages:

```js
const a = 1;
console.log(a);
```

```ts
const a = 1;
console.log(a);
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```css
.container {
  background-color: red;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">Hello, World!</div>
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

```json
{
  "name": "Next.js MDX Blog",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is a test blog",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## Markdown Elements

### Lists

Here's an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Blockquote

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.

### Table

| Feature | Description | Difficulty |
