# Mastering Full-Screen Mode in React: A Custom Hook for Seamless Popovers

![Cover Image](/full-screen-react.webp)

Creating an immersive experience in web applications is essential. Full-screen mode eliminates distractions, enhancing user focus. However, managing UI components like popovers in full-screen can be challenging since the root element changes from `document.body` to the full-screen element. In this guide, we'll create a custom hook, `useFullScreenHook`, to manage full-screen functionality effectively.

### **Why Full-Screen Mode?**

Full-screen mode maximizes screen space, improves focus, and is ideal for media players, presentations, and interactive dashboards. Yet, handling popovers requires special attention, as they might not render correctly if attached to `document.body`.

### **Creating the `useFullScreenHook`**

This hook will:

1. Provide a `ref` to the container that will enter full-screen.
2. Return `popoverContainer`, dynamically updating based on full-screen state.
3. Include `requestFullScreen` to trigger full-screen mode.

```jsx
import { useRef, useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useFullScreenHook() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const [popoverContainer, setPopoverContainer] = useState(document.body);

  const requestFullScreen = () => {
    const element = ref.current;
    if (element) {
      element.requestFullscreen?.() ||
        element.webkitRequestFullscreen?.() ||
        element.mozRequestFullScreen?.() ||
        element
          .msRequestFullscreen?.()
          .catch((err) => console.error("Error:", err));
    }
  };

  const onFullScreenChange = () => {
    setPopoverContainer(
      document.fullscreenElement ||
        document.webkitFullscreenElement ||
        document.mozFullScreenElement ||
        document.msFullscreenElement ||
        document.body
    );
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", onFullScreenChange);
    return () =>
      document.removeEventListener("fullscreenchange", onFullScreenChange);
  }, []);

  return { ref, popoverContainer, requestFullScreen };
}

export default useFullScreenHook;
```

### **Using the Hook**

Here's how you can use this hook in a component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import useFullScreenHook from "./useFullScreenHook";
import { createPortal } from "react-dom";

function FullScreenComponent() {
  const { ref, popoverContainer, requestFullScreen } = useFullScreenHook();

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={ref} style={{ height: "400px", position: "relative" }}>
        <p>Your content here</p>
        {createPortal(
          <div style={{ position: "absolute", top: 10, right: 10 }}>
            Popover Content
          </div>,
          popoverContainer
        )}
      </div>
      <button onClick={requestFullScreen}>Enter Full Screen</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FullScreenComponent;
```

### **How It Works**

1. **Ref Assignment**: The `ref` is attached to the container element.
2. **Dynamic Popover Container**: `popoverContainer` updates based on whether the container is in full-screen mode.
3. **Event Listener**: `onFullScreenChange` adjusts `popoverContainer` to the full-screen element or reverts to `document.body`.

### **Extending the Hook**

Add features like:

- **Exit Full-Screen**: Include an `exitFullScreen` function.
- **Full-Screen State**: Track whether the element is in full-screen.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Handle entering and exiting full-screen events.

### **Conclusion**

With `useFullScreenHook`, managing full-screen mode in React becomes straightforward. It ensures that popovers and other UI elements are correctly positioned, providing a seamless user experience. Try integrating this hook into your next project and see the difference it makes in handling full-screen transitions!
